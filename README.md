# PTSD-form

An HTML form used to evaluate patience for PTSD. The front end is developed in HTML, 
The back end is developed in JS to perform neccessary calculations and print out a result. 

This can be applied to any site by simply copying and pasting the code.

TODO
- Would like to add a seperate JS file to handle all the calculations and just link to the source
